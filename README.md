# Refactoring_project

Title was changed from website to Horiseon Social Solution Services.

Changed all semantics from div to;
header
nav
img
main
section
aside
footer

Nav bar button "search engine optimization" wasn't linking to respective section until id and class were added to the correct section.
    Removed class and added them as alt attributes.

Element nav was updated in CSS so respective list are referenced correctly.

Adding img reference link including height and width, replaced that of the hero class in CSS.
    Returned height and width to CSS.

Following CSS, class content was moved to follow the html placement.

Correctly linked the section ID's referenced from nav to respective CSS upon correct placement of elements.

Added alt attributes
